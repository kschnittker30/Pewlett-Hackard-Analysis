# Project Overview
Analyzing Pewlett-Hackard employee data tables to identify employees approaching retirement, as well as employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The following queries will be developed:

  -Retirement Titles (all job titles of retirable employee)
  
  -Unique Titles (most recent job title of retirable active employee) 
  
  -Retiring Titles (retirable active employee count based on job title)
  
  -Mentorship Eligibilty (active employees eligible to participate in mentorship program)
 
# Results

-There is a large population of employees approaching retirable age. The population should be reviewed to determine how many of the retirable employees qualify for full retirement benefits. Retirable age employees that do not meet the full retirement benefits may extend their years of service to qualfiy for full benefits. 

-Pewlett Hackard can review retirable population to determine if hiring back employees as contractors is an option.

-There is over 70k employees reaching retirable age and of them there only 2 are in management position. This can be a result of Pewlett Hackard having an affective management mentorship/retention/etc program. 

-With a high population of retirable employees, Pewlett Hackard should evaulate the job functions to determine if the company can reorganize, modernize, consolidate, etc. job functions so not all 70K plus positions need to be refilled.
  
# Summary

The total retirable employees whose positions must be filled is 72,458.

There is sufficient retirable employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. Since two managers are retiring, Pewlett Hackard will need to include a mangement succession within the mentorship program.  The existing queries of mentorship eligible employees includes only employees born between January 1, 1965 to December 31, 1965. The total retirable employees far exceeds the mentorship eligible employees. It is recommend to expand the eligible mentorship program to include a larger population, including employees with who have several years of experience with the company. It is also recommended for the company to have an annual mentorship program to ensure the next generation of employees are ready to fill in the vacant positions as employees retire.
