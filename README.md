There is sufficient retirable employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. Since two managers are retiring, Pewlett Hackard will need to include a mangement succession within the mentorship program.  The existing queries of mentorship eligible employees includes only employees born between January 1, 1965 to December 31, 1965. The total retirable employees far exceeds the mentorship eligible employees. It is recommend to expand the eligible mentorship program to include a larger population, including employees with who have several years of experience with the company. It is also recommended for the company to have annual mentorship programs to ensure the next generation of employees are ready to fill in the vacant positions as employees retire.
